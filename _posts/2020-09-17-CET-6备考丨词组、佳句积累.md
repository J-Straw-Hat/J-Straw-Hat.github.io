>The importance of building trust between employers and employees.

The relationship between employers and employees is based on the labour contract that they have signed together. However, if this relationship **is to** develop well and the two sides **intend to achieve success through cooperation**. trust **has to be built** between employers and employees. 

On the one hand, employers should communicate their vision, mission and code of ethics to their employees in order to inspire employees' trust in the company. On the other hand, employees should strictly comply with company or industry rules and regulations. **Otherwise**, any irregular or deceitful practice will easily destroy the trust between employers and employees. In fact, trust is the foundation on which companies are built. Without trust, no company will be able to survive, and **no individual can fully explore his or her potential**. 

Both employers and employees **should bear in mind that** trust is not built overnight. It requires months, even years of hard work, **and yet** it may be still very fragile. The trust between employers and employees **needs to be nurtured and protected by both sides** carefully.
