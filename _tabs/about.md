> "All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection." ——**David Wheeler**

Hey, guys. 😆

I am a sophomore majoring in [CS](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E4%B8%8E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF/663582?fr=aladdin), loving technology and mathematics. 

Now I am learning:

- [x] Assembly Languages
- [x] C/C++
- [ ] Java
- [x] Markdown
- [x] $LaTeX$
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] Git


I am thrilled that you can find my blog, which was built in Dec, 2020, and, is currently powered by Jekyll with [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). The blog mainly records the ideas and notes pertain to programming as well as college life.

Hope you can learn something in my blog and **leave your comment!**  👍
